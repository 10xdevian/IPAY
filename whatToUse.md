TL;DR for production-level code

Donâ€™t overuse global state. Overusing Recoil/Redux is a common anti-pattern.

Keep local state local (useState) for inputs, small flags, and temporary UI.

Use Recoil for shared state (modals, feature flags, auth status, cross-component data).

Keep code readable, predictable, and encapsulated.
